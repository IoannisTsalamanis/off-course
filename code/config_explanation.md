## Config explanation
The following explains what each element of the config JSON file refers to

### Config_example
the config_example.json can be used as template or the config.json

### Locations

The following are locatons for saving files:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|ais_path|location of the AIS data|
|cers_path|location of the CERS data|
|ship_class_path|location of the ship class/type data|
|processing_path|location for saving files generated by the code|
|location_path|location for port latitude and longitudes|

###Â Required files

The following are data files that must be provided in csv format:
